# Welcome To Rorik's Saga
Rorik’s Adventure is the project that I’ve had the most fun working on.
Planning the world map, plot, and character backstories was very addictive.
Doing it with friends who helped me make custom graphics for this game was a wonderful experience.

It’s a simple 2D isometric RPG game with everything that a good RPG should have, 
like character progression, an awesome fighting system, looting, immersive quests, and much more.
The game’s main plotline is still in the making, but I plan to set it in a dark Nordic saga-like theme with
lots of references to Norse mythology.

## Functionality

## What's Next?

In the near future, I plan on implementing character inventory, 
fighting mechanics, user progressions, player classes, monsters and opponents, bosses and much more :)
